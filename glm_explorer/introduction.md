## Introduction

With this little application you can simulate data with known effects and properties and then can fit GLM to this data.
The aim of this little App is to let you explore interactively Generalized Linear Models, to fit these to data that fits and don't fit and the show you the resulting diagnostic plots. 
Because we will use simulated data, you know the truth and can explore what happens if we do not model this truth correctly.
`Exercises` will guide you through.
Overall you should get a better understanding of GLMs, their application and diagnostics.


You can reach the app by clicking on the `App` tab in the navigation bar.
The app consists of two modules:

1. `Simulate`
2. `Model`

Under `Simulate`you can specify how to simulate data.
Under `Model` you can specify which model should be fitted to this data.
Additionally, the `Summary`, a plot of `coefficients` and `Diagnostic` plots are given for the fitted model.




## Data Simulation

Data can be generated from a GLM (`Simulate` tab).
The simulated data can depend on two predictors (one continuous and one categorical) and their interaction.
You can vary the number of observations, the distribution the data comes from, the link function and the variability within the data.

The simulation model can be written as:

$$Y_i \sim D(\mu_i)$$
$$\eta_i = f(\mu_i)$$
$$\eta_i = \alpha + \beta_{x} x_i + \beta_{fac} fac_i + \beta_{x:fac} x_i fac_i$$

The distribution of the response ($D()$) can be choosen from:

1. Normal Distribution: $N(\mu, \sigma)$
2. Poission Distribution: $Pois(\mu)$
3. Negative Binomial Distribution: $NB(\mu, \theta)$

The link-function $f()$can be choosen from:

1. identity link: $f(\mu) = \mu$
2. log link: $f(\mu) = log(\mu)$

Effects that can be varied are:

1. Intercept: $\alpha$
2. Continuous predictors: $x$
3. Categorical predictor with two levels (A and B): $fac$
4. The interaction between the categorical predictor and the continuous predictor: $x:fac$

Additionally, the variance can be varied (via "\sigma" for Normal data and $\theta$ for Negative Binomial data).


You can specify these all in the `Simulate` tab on the left.
On the right of this tab you see a plot of the simulated data.


## Fit a model to this data

In the `Model`tab you can specify on the left how the GLM should be fitted, which distribution and link should be assumed and which predictors should be included.
On the right you see:

1. The simulated data
2. The fitted model (solid line)
3. The pointwise 95% Confidence Interval (dashed line)
4. The 90% Prediction Interval (PI, shaded band). The PI is based on simulations from the models.

Below you find the corresponding R command.


## Diagnose the model

The App incorporates several model output and diagnostics:

1. `Model Summary`
2. `Model Coefficients`
3. `Model Diagnostics`

Within each, you can change the fitted model on the left to see how this changes the diagnostics.


`Model Summary` print the resulting `summary()`.

`Model Coefficients` show a plot of the estimated coefficients (black dots),
their 95% confidence interval (black lines) and the true (=used for simulation) coefficients.

`Model Diagnostics` shows for diagnostics plots from basic R:

1. (Pearson) Residuals vs. Fitted values
2. Observed vs. Fitted values
3. QQ-Plot
4. (Pearson) Residuals vs. Leverage


Below you find two plots from the [DHARMa package](https://github.com/florianhartig/DHARMa) for diagnosing GL(M)M.
The left plot shows a QQ-Plot of quantile residuals (check the DHARMa page for more information), the right plot quantile residuals vs. fitted values.


## Exercises

Open now the `Exercises` Tab and follow them. 

You can also find the [here](https://github.com/EDiLD/shiny_apps/blob/master/glm_explorer/exercises.md) (click on `Raw` the get the file).
It best if have the exercises open ion a separate window.

You can always reset to start by pressing `F5` in your browser.
