## Exercises

### Gausian Linear Model
#### Data Generation

1. Change only the intercept. What happens to the simulated data
2. Set the intercept back to 0, change only the slope. What happens to the simulated data
3. Set the intercept to 3, change the slope.  What happens to the simulated data
4. Set intercept and slope both back to zero. Change only the group difference. What do you observe
5. Set the group difference to 4, change only the slope. What happens to the simulated data
6. Set the group difference to 4, and the slope to 4.
Change only the intercept. What happens to the simulated data
7. Set the intercept to 0, the group difference to 2, the slope to 2.
Change the interaction. What do you observe
8. Set the intercept to 0, the group difference to 2, the slope to 2 and the interaction to 0.
Change sigma. 


#### Model fitting

1. Set all to zero. Set the intercept to 1 and the slope to -2.
In the model tab: What is the difference between `intercept' and 'x' as fitted terms
2. Keep the intercept to 1 and the slope to -2. Set the group difference to 3.  What is the difference between 'x', 'fac' and 'both' as fitted terms
3.  Keep the intercept to 1, the slope to -2 and the group difference to 3. Set the interaction to -5. What is the difference between 'both' and interaction as fited terms
4. Keep all settings. Change sigma. What happens to the Confidence intervals
